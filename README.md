# Shipmate

Shipmate is an online delivery management system that will eliminate the need for manual intervention, and everything will be managed automatically. 
Customers will receive real-time tracking information, eliminating the need for tracking calls and manual management. All data will be stored in a database, 
making it more secure and reducing the chance of manual errors. We have developed the front end using ReactJS, the back end using Flask, and have used
MongoDB for storing data.

# Project Objectives and Usefulness:
Our main objective is to digitalize the process of delivery management. Right from creating a new order, tracking it, until it is delivered. 

This application is useful for many individuals, some of them are
<h3>End Users</h3> They will be able to create a new shipment that they want to deliver. 
<h3>Administrators</h3> They will be able to manage all the users, shipments, order assignments, etc.
<h3>Drivers</h3> Drivers will be able to pick up the order and deliver it to the specified address. This will allow the users to save time. Users will also be able 
to track their orders and will have an estimate of when the order is to be delivered. Administrators will be able to reduce all the manual work which was done 
on paper previously. Drivers will have all the shipment information electronically and will not have to rely on paperwork.

# Technical Description:
### Data:
We have generated a lot of random data according to the JSON schema of each collection in our database. We have used Python scripts to achieve this task. 
Apart from this, we are able to add, delete, and insert data from our user interface.

### Tools:
We have followed MVC (Model View Controller) architecture pattern for our application.

### Model:
We have developed the APIs using the Flask library. We have also used the PyMongo library to work with MongoDB

### View:
The front end of our application is developed using ReactJS, HTML, CSS, Material UI and, javascript.

Controller:
The flask application acts as a controller in our application.
